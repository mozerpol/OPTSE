In this repositorium I'll put some Matlab code, which helped me pass the OptimizaÃ§Ã£o de Sistemas de Energia course at ISEP in Porto. Rather, this repository will be like a souvenir ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹

In these tasks I used Matlab R2020b for linux systems with Optimization Toolbox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_Toolbox)
